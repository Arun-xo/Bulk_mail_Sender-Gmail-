The application reads recipient details from an Excel file. The required format is as follows:

| Column Name       | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `from_email`     | Sender's Gmail address                                  |
| `password`       | App password for the sender's Gmail account            |
| `sal`            | Salutation (e.g., Mr., Ms., Dr.)                        |
| `signature`      | Signature name to be used in the email                 |
| `to_email`       | Recipient's email address                              |
| `subject`        | Subject of the email                                   |
| `html_file`      | Full path to the HTML email template file              |

**Example:**

| from_email         | password  | sal  | signature  | to_email       | subject       | html_file                            |
|--------------------|----------|------|------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| sender1@gmail.com | abcd1234 | Mr.  | John Doe   | user1@abc.com | Business Deal | C:\Users\user\Desktop\email1.html  |
| sender2@gmail.com | efgh5678 | Ms.  | Jane Smith | user2@xyz.com | New Offer     | C:\Users\user\Desktop\email2.html  |

### 2. **Launching the Application**
1. **Run the application:** If using the Python script, execute:
   ```bash
   python Bulk_Mail_Sender.py
   ```
   If you have an executable version, simply double-click the `.exe` file.

2. **Load the Excel File:** Click on the "Load Excel File" button and select the prepared Excel file.

3. **Set Email Sending Delay:** Enter the time delay (in seconds) between each email to avoid being flagged as spam. Recommended delay:
   - 5-10 seconds for normal sending
   - 15-20 seconds for high-volume sending

4. **Start Sending Emails:** Click on the "Send Emails" button to begin the process.

5. **Pause/Resume Sending:** The app allows you to pause and resume the process at any time.

6. **Monitor Progress:** The progress bar updates in real-time, displaying sent and pending emails.

7. **Check Logs and Reports:**
   - The log section provides real-time updates on sent emails.
   - If any emails fail to send, a failure report (`failed_emails_report.xlsx`) is generated.

## Additional Features
- **Automatic Network Monitoring:** If the network disconnects, the process is paused and resumes automatically once connectivity is restored.
- **Multiple Sender Accounts:** The app rotates between multiple sender email IDs to distribute sending volume.
- **HTML Email Support:** The application allows sending emails using pre-designed HTML templates.
- **Custom Signature Per Sender:** The signature varies based on the senderâ€™s information in the Excel file.

## Troubleshooting
### 1. **Email Not Sending?**
- Ensure that the sender's Gmail account allows app passwords.
- Verify that the password entered in the Excel file is correct.
- Check your internet connection.

### 2. **HTML File Not Found Error?**
- Ensure the `html_file` column contains the correct full file path.
- The file should exist in the specified location.

### 3. **Gmail Sending Limits?**
- Each Gmail account has a daily sending limit (typically 500 for free accounts, 2,000 for Google Workspace accounts).
- If you are sending a large volume of emails, use multiple sender accounts and adjust the sending delay.
